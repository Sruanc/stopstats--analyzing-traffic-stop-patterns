The attributes reported vary from one police department to another; for this project we have focused on data from the Washington State Patrol. Due to the high number of traffic stops included in the dataset, we have restricted our analysis to traffic stops made in 2018, the most recent year provided in the dataset. The second data source used is the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS). Data was queried using the ACS API. Key demographic variables were collected for Washington state using 2018 5-year estimates at the census tract level.")

    st.write("One limitation of the dataset is that Washington State Patrol generally performs traffic stops on highways, which may not be as representative of the population of the tract where the stop occurred compared to stops performed by local police departments on non-highway roads and streets. Additionally, a significant portion of our geospatial analysis was performed via Folium. Folium had limited computational efficiency to plot large datasets, so we chose to limit the data scope for the sake of improved dashboard performance. For the mapping portion, data was reduced to only include census tracts and police stops in King County. We randomly sampled n = 10,000 points from the police stops within King County, which was 20.52% of the King County police stops. Subsequent analysis and visualizations will use this reduced sample.")
